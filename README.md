# RFM-LC
## Codes for Robust Feature Matching via Local Consensus
We propose a robust feature matching method of remote sensing images based on local consensus. This method is based on the neighborhood and motion vector consensus constraints of potential real correspondences between two images of the same object or scene. 
## Requirement
RFM-LC requires VLfeat. You can download it at: [https://www.vlfeat.org](https://www.vlfeat.org)
